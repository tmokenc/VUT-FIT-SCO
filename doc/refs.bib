  abstract = {Salsa20 is a family of 256-bit stream ciphers designed in 2005 and submitted to eSTREAM, the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project. Salsa20 has progressed to the third round of eSTREAM without any changes. The 20-round stream cipher Salsa20/20 is consistently faster than AES and is recommended by the designer for typical cryptographic applications. The reduced-round ciphers Salsa20/12 and Salsa20/8 are among the fastest 256-bit stream ciphers available and are recommended for applications where speed is more important than confidence. The fastest known attacks use ≈ 2153 simple operations against Salsa20/7, ≈ 2249 simple operations against Salsa20/8, and ≈ 2255 simple operations against Salsa20/9, Salsa20/10, etc. In this paper, the Salsa20 designer presents Salsa20 and discusses the decisions made in the Salsa20 design.},

  abstract = {ChaCha8 is a 256-bit stream cipher based on the 8-round cipher Salsa20/8. The changes from Salsa20/8 to ChaCha8 are designed to improve diffusion per round, conjecturally increasing resistance to cryptanalysis, while preserving—and often improving—time per round. ChaCha12 and ChaCha20 are analogous modifications of the 12-round and 20-round ciphers Salsa20/12 and Salsa20/20. This paper presents the ChaCha family and explains the differences between Salsa20 and ChaCha.},

  abstract = {Poly1305-AES is a state-of-the-art message-authentication code suitable for a wide variety of applications. Poly1305-AES computes a 16-byte authenticator of a variable-length message, using a 16-byte AES key, a 16-byte additional key, and a 16-byte nonce. The security of Poly1305-AES is very close to the security of AES; the security gap is at most 14DdL/16e/2106 if messages have at most L bytes, the attacker sees at most 264 authenticated messages, and the attacker attempts D forgeries. Poly1305-AES can be computed at extremely high speed: for example, fewer than 3.1` + 780 Athlon cycles for an `-byte message. This speed is achieved without precomputation; consequently, 1000 keys can be handled simultaneously without cache misses. Special-purpose hardware can compute Poly1305-AES at even higher speed. Poly1305- AES is parallelizable, incremental, and not subject to any intellectual- property claims.},
